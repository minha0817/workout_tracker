## Running the projects

You need **TWO** terminal windows/tabs for this app to run (or some other plan for running two Node processes).

1. In one terminal, `cd` into `react-front-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` or `yarn start`

2. In the other terminal, `cd` into `express-back-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the server.

3. Visit http://localhost:3000/
